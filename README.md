# Playing with the raw form of Enron e-mail dataset

I have tried to get my hands on data mining by finding out 100 most common words used in the emails of the enron corpus.

About the dataset: 
The Enron e-mail dataset contains over 600,000 e-mails from 158 users. Find the dataset here https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/

Why this dataset:
Enron Corporation was a famous American energy, commodities, services company. Enron scandal, a well-planned accounting fraud, led to the companyâ€™s bankruptcy. FERC publicly released e-mails from Enron to investigate its involvement in the scandal.
As far as I know this dataset is the only email dataset publicly available.
